## Summary

.pull-left[

Launched in 2017 by the European Space Agency, part of their Copernicus program.

Orbits at altitude of 824km

Measuring pollutants in Earth's atmosphere, including:
- Ozone (O3)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
- Methane (CH4)
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Cost: â‚¬45.5 million

# Summary: Resoloution


- 1 day revisit time

- The Sentinel 5p sensor has 3 instruments: Tropomi, IASI-NG, and Pandonia.
Tropomi is the main instrument and has a swath width of **2,600 km**.

- It operates in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared spectral ranges.

# Summary: Limitations 

**Limited Spatial Resoloution:** The spatial resolution of Sentinel 5p is relatively coarse compared to other satellite sensors.


**Limited Crossover:** The sensor is primarily designed to monitor atmospheric composition, so it may not be suitable for other applications.

# Applications: Air Quality Monitoring 1
#### Concentrations of pollutants can be monitored using Sentinel-5P.

.pull-left[
The Tropomi sensor is designed for atmospheric monitoring, quantifying concentration of pollutants. 

These pollutants have potential negative effects on the environment and human health. 

- Sentinel-5P data provides key information on the wider-scale sources of pollutants. 
- It's data can validate air quality models, allowing better understanding of the pollutants behaviours.

# Reflection
#### How will the data be used in the future?

---
# Future Developments
- The European Space Agency is planning to launch the Sentinel 5p Second Generation satellite in 2023.
- This satellite will have improved capabilities and will be able to monitor additional pollutants such as methane and formaldehyde.
